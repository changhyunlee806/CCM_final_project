        "**Main idea:**\n",
        "Since GPT2 is a decoder transformer, the last token of the input sequence is used to make predictions about the next token that should follow the input. This means that the last token of the input sequence contains all the information needed in the prediction. With this in mind we can use that information to make a prediction in a classification task instead of generation task.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, instead of using first token embedding to make prediction like we do in Bert, we will use the last token embedding to make prediction with GPT2.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since we only cared about the first token in Bert, we were padding to the right. Now in GPT2 we are using the last token for prediction so we will need to pad on the left. Because of a nice upgrade to HuggingFace Transformers we are able to configure the GPT2 Tokenizer to do just that.\n",
